(CNN)"Call me Joseph," says Gong Yoo, modestly.

“叫我Joseph吧， 孔刘（面对CNN的记者）谦逊地说。

It's an ironic suggestion, because if there's one thing that this tall, chiseled mega-star clearly is not, it's an average Joe.
Currently South Korea's most popular leading man, Gong is the star of the recent smash hit television series "Guardian: The Lonely and Great God" -- better known as "Goblin".
这是个讽刺的建议，如果说孔刘看起来普普通通（Joseph在西方文化是个很普通的名字），显然很难让人信服， 用外表俊朗的超级明星来评价他，毫不夸张。
作为韩国的流行领军人物，孔刘在最近红透半边天的电视剧“孤单而又灿烂的神” （“鬼怪”一名更为人所知）中出演主要角色。 
For playing the titular character, a god-like guardian with supernatural powers who seeks a human bride to end his immortal life, Gong won the best actor prize at the 53rd Baeksang Arts Awards, considered the Golden Globes of South Korea.
孔刘在剧中扮演了一位具有超能力的如神般存在的将军，他为了终结自己永不消灭的亡灵而在人间寻找他的新娘。凭借这一看似英雄的角色，孔刘获得了第53届百想艺术大奖最佳男演员奖。 百想被视作韩国的金球奖，其分量在韩国可见一斑。

The show has achieved the second highest television ratings in Korean history.
而这部电视剧也跻身为韩国电视史上收视率第二高的剧集。
"It's a piece I was really worried about. I certainly never thought Asia and the world would love it so much," he tells Talk Asia.
“这部戏是我特别在意的， 当然，我也没有想到亚洲甚至全球观众能如此喜欢它”， 他面对Talk Asia如是说。
While the 37-year-old heartthrob has been in the entertainment industry for nearly two decades, a string of successful projects in recent years, combined with the growing global mass appeal of South Korean popular culture, has propelled his fame across Asia and beyond.
如今这位37岁的魅力型男已在娱乐产业中沉浮两载， 凭借近年来一系列颇为成功的作品，加之韩国流行文化国际化大趋势的推波助澜，使孔刘的名气远播亚洲，甚至全球。 
"I am someone who likes creativity," Gong tells Talk Asia.
“我是一个热爱创新的人,”孔刘告诉Talk Asia。
"I tend to pick projects that give me a sense of freshness. So my filmography, especially after hitting my 30s, has become a lot more diverse."
"我倾向于挑选一些能带给我新鲜感的剧本。因此我的作品，特别是30岁之后的作品，就变得更加多元化了。"

Big break
巨大突破
Gong's big break came in 2007 in the TV rom-com "Coffee Prince", in which he played a rich café owner who falls in love with a member of his staff he (mistakenly) believes to be male.
孔刘演艺生涯的巨大突破始于2007年的一部浪漫偶像喜剧---“咖啡王子一号店”，他在剧中饰演一位富有的咖啡店老板， 并随后在故事中与他起初误认为是男人的咖啡店员工坠入爱河。
The drama drew attention for addressing homosexuality, still a taboo in conservative South Korea.
这部剧引起了观众们对同性恋的讨论和关注，而该话题在当时民风保守的韩国来说，仍然是一个禁忌。
Then in 2011 -- after completing his mandatory military service -- Gong showcased his serious acting chops in "Silenced", a film based on the true story of the sexual abuse of at least eight children at a school for the hearing-impaired in Gwangju.
转眼到2011年，服完兵役的孔刘在电影《熔炉》呈现了其严肃而又认真的演技。 该电影情节改编自真人真事，八逾名听力受损的儿童在光州的某学校遭受性虐待。 
Again, it was a role that tackled a controversial issue.
不变的是，这次的角色依旧充满了争议。

Of the six people who were indicted for the abuse, only two received jail sentences and both were for less than a year. Two others were given suspended sentences while the remaining pair was acquitted.
在被指控实施虐待的六人当中，仅有两人被量刑且刑期均不超过一年。另外两人则被判缓刑，而最后的两人无罪释放。
The film sparked public outrage over the justice that had -- or perhaps hadn't -- been served, and led to the passing of the "Dogani Law", which imposed tougher punishments for sex crimes against children and the disabled.
电影激起了民众对司法公正在韩国社会现状的不满与愤懑，他们甚至怀疑司法公正从不存在。同时电影也加速了熔炉法的通过，该法规定了对针对儿童和残疾人实施的性犯罪更为严厉的刑罚。
For Gong making the film was a landmark moment in shaping the direction of his career.
而对于孔刘来说，参与这部电影的拍摄是在为自己铺设的职业生涯的一个标志性时刻。
"This was one of the first times when I thought, if I really have some sort of influence ... isn't this something I should be using it for?" he says.
“我第一时间想到，如果我真的拥有某种影响力，那么是不是该针对这件事加以利用呢？”他谈到。 
"Rather than taking to the streets to protest, the most effective thing I could do as an actor would be (to use my popularity to) push for funding ... so this film could be made."
“除了上街游行，作为一名演员我能够做的最有效力的事大概是用自己的知名度来推动筹款过程，制作电影吧。”
Mainstream success
主要成功
In 2016, Gong made his breakthrough in the international market with the zombie apocalypse thriller "Train to Busan", which debuted at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.
2016年，孔刘通过出演僵尸灾难惊悚片“釜山行”实现了个人对国际市场的突破，而后该片在享有盛誉的戛纳电影节崭露头角。
The film sold nearly five million tickets in its opening week in South Korea -- a record in that country.
这部电影在韩国上映的第一周便售出500万的观影人次，创造了韩国相关记录。
Gong says he is proud to work on projects that raise the profile of his home nation internationally.
孔说能参与到提升韩国国际声望的作品中，他感到很荣幸。
"Rather than me gaining international recognition (for 'Train To Busan'), I am proud that these creative projects from Korea are being recognized and loved."
“相较于通过《釜山行》获得更高的个人国际辨识度，我更希望这些来自韩国的富有创造力的作品被世界认可和喜爱。”
"Twitter, Instagram, I don't do it at all"
Twitter， Instagram， 我从来不用
Amid this soaring popularity, however, it's easy to sense that in some ways Gong is the reluctant star. A celebrity who often craves to be average Joseph.
尽管孔刘人气急剧上升，人们却依旧能很轻易地感受到，某种程度来说，他并不愿意成为一个人气巨星， 相反， 却渴望做一个普通人。
"The camera," Gong says, in reference to the press intrusion on his private life, "I hate it. That's something I need to endure while working as an actor. In the end, because of fame, 'Gong Yoo' exists. It's the driving force that keeps me going.”
“照相机这东西，”孔说， 实际上却指媒体对他私人生活的侵犯， “我挺憎恨的，那是我作为演员身份工作时需要忍受的东西。是名誉最终成就了“孔刘”，这是我前进的驱动力。”

"But if there's something you gain, there's also something you can lose. Therefore, I try not to showcase my personal life."
“但生活总是有得必有失。所以我尽力保护我的私人生活不被曝光。”
For example, Gong has openly discussed his dislike for and distrust of social media.
比如，孔曾公开表达他对社交媒体的抵触和不信任。
"Twitter, Instagram, I don't do it at all. This," he says, referring to our interview, "is better than social media."
“Twitter，Instagram，我从来不用。 这个，”他说着，示意我们的采访， “比社交媒体更好。”
While acting may leave little chance to escape the spotlight, Gong has, on balance, decided the price of fame is worth paying to be able to practice his craft.
表演或许能使他短暂地逃离聚光灯，权衡之下，孔刘认为用名誉的代价换得磨砺演技的机会还是值得的。
"When I become a character in a movie or drama ... I can think about the character only and not the complicated matters of my own life," he says.
“当我成为某部电影或戏剧中的某个角色时， 我只去想角色，屏蔽我个人生活中的各种繁琐的事，”他说道。
"I feel ecstasy in those moments and it's what keeps me going as an actor. It's not about the money, it's not about the honor."
“我经常在这些表演的时刻入迷忘我，这是我作为一个演员前进的原动力。它和金钱无关，更和名利无关。”

对不起，我最近中了一鸡毒。作为一个不太喜说唱的我，竟然收藏了 Iggy Azalea一整张歌单。
Iggy，美国发展的澳大利亚歌手，风格意识流说唱（这个名字也是很厉害的样子哦，然而我也不知道她怎么意识流了呵呵）。看早年的专辑封面有超模的架势，再看看现在，真是一张整残以后的脸。这张封面真是好喜欢，目测这个时候还没整鼻子。
